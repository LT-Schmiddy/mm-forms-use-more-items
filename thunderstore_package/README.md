Special thanks to Reonu for creating and implementing the assets for Zora Link to use the Bow and Hookshot! This update wouldn't have happened without him!

Additional thanks to ProxyMM for the `ObjDepLoader` library (and for helping us troubleshoot all the crashes we were having)

This mod requires [EZTR](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/) and ProxyMM's [ObjDepLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/ProxyMM/ObjDepLoader/).
